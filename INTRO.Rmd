I have been playing around with teaching R through downloadable video podcasts and feel that it works well for getting people up to speed with some of the basics in a user-friendly way. I have also decided to stick with the open-source ethos for R and provide these to all users who want access. As is the case with all programming languages, there is always more than one way to do something, and these represent my own personal preference for a variety of analyses (at least in terms of teaching others how to do them). These demonstrations are for Windows OS for the time being. Mac/Linux users will have to learn some conversions for some commands. I am moving my day-to-day computing over to Mac anyway, so one day I will probably end up with Mac only demonstrations. The course is ever expanding, and I will be adding new chapters as time goes on. If there is an analysis you would particularly like to see, I might be able to create a podcast so please contact me with your suggestions and requests (a.jackson(at)tcd.ie).

You will of course need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) before you can follow along with the podcast course. There are also some script template files and datafiles (I suggest you right click and save these to your local disk) to accompany some of the podcasts below. Many browsers will play these files in a frame, but I strongly suggest you download each podcast to enjoy at your convenience in your media player of choice ([Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL837?locale=en_US) is often a default, or   [VLC player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)) to avoid problems such as stutter or lack of content.
