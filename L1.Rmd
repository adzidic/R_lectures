#Installing  R for the first time!


## About R

R is free, open-source software, available for all commonly used operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. You can download it form the web-site [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

**IMPORTANT: Regardless of your operating system, you should install R before installing RStudio.**

**IMPORTANT: R is case and character sensitive language**



#RStudio


RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R which works with the standard version of R higher than version 2.11. available from RStudio web-site [RStudion](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Source editor for writing scripts, workspae to view objects in the global environment, dataviewer for inspecting elements, searchable command history, plots pane, Rpackage manager, Integrated R help

![RStudio RMarkdown first screen!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/RMarkdown_intro.jpg)

In Console window you can clearly see the exact version of R software like one on machine that created this Rnotebook (R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) -- "Sincere Pumpkin Patch").
Executive R code is written within Chunk!

##RStudio session

You have to take care about two things within RStudio session:

1.RObjects created within session

2.RScripts written for particular session - in this case RMarkdown!


## Prompt change

You can easily change your default prompt (>) in R to something else like RStudio>:
```{r}
options(prompt="RStudio>")
```
If you want to set it back use:
```{r}
options(prompt=">")
```

## Keyboard shortcuts


Description | MAC | PC
--- | ---| ---
Navigate command (last) | $\uparrow$  | $\uparrow$
Navigate command (next) | $\downarrow$ | $\downarrow$
Last matching command | CMD + $\uparrow$ | CTRL + $\uparrow$ 
TAB completion | TAB | TAB
Dismiss completion popup | Esc | Esc

##Setting working directory

If you are not using RProject default working directory could be set as follows:


First go to Tools and Global options as shown on the picture:

![RStudio Tools Global Options!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/Global_options.jpg)

Then you change RGeneral default working directory (black rectangle), press apply and OK.

![RStudio Tools Working directory!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/Working_Directory.jpg)

To check it you can type in:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```


 
#Basic calculations - use RStudio as a calculator

You can use RStudio to perform basic calculations: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponents and modulo.

Addition

```{r}
2+7
```
Subtraction

```{r}
11-3
```
Division

```{r}
18/3
```
Multiplication

```{r}
5*8
```
Exponents

```{r}
2^4
```
But be carefull if you want to write 2 to the power of 3 minus 1, i.e. 2 to the power of 2, while you have to put this number in paremtheses:
Good example:
```{r}
2^(3-1)
```
Otherwise you get 2 to the power of 3 and then minus 1:
```{r}
2^3-1
```
**Carefull with negative numbers**, while R considers a negative number -2 as -1*2, therefore you need parenthese around (-2).

Modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus). In this example 5 divided by 2 is 2 and the remainder is 1.
```{r}
5 %% 2
```

You can also transfer a bit complicated formula
$$(\frac{0.14 * (1-0.14)}{24})^{1/3}$$
to a R executable code:
```{r}
(0.14*(1-0.14)/24)^(1/3)
```

## Assignment 1

1. Calculate in RStudio following expression for x=3:
$$\frac{2x +51}{3^{-4.2+5.62}} = ?$$
2. What is the solution for negative number five squared and added number two?





Solution 1:
```{r}
x<-3
(2*x+51)/3^(-4.2+5.62)
```

Solution 2:
```{r}
(-5)^2+2
```



# R Objects

## Comments

Comments are important in R and they start after hash mark (#). This kind of annotation could be usefull other people using your code!
```{r}
#This is a comment
2+2 #Example of addition
```

## Assigning and removing R Object

Suppose we want to give a object called a a value of 53.
We can perform that by writting following code in R Markdown:

```{r}
a<- 53
```
We can check if our object exists with typing his name.

```{r}
a
```
To check if our object exist in R working environment we can use list function ls().
```{r}
ls()
```
To remove object a from the R working environment we can use remove function rm().

```{r}
rm(a)
```

After we remove our object from R environment we can check our list of objects with list function. 
```{r}
ls()
```

Our previously created object a is not anymore in R environment.


#Functions

## Assigning R Objectes with combine function

Suppose we want to make one object with house mouse body weight. 
We can use **combine** function to do that. Example: mouse.wts <-c(). In brackets are measurements divided by comma.

![House mouse!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/House_mouse.jpeg)

Photo source: [House mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse)
```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clearing the environment of any left over objects from a previous analysis
mouse.wts <-c(16.6, 12, 10.9, 15.9, 25, 14.5, 18.2, 13.8, 21, 21.5) #creating a vector with house mouse body weight in grams
```

##Class function

Class function can be used to determine class of particular object. 
R has 5 basic atomic classes

    logical (e.g.,RUE, FALSE)
    integer (e.g., 1L, 2L)
    numeric (real or decimal) (e.g, 2, 2.0, pi)
    complex (e.g, 1 + 0i, 1 + 4i)
    character (e.g, "a", "b")
  
Suppose we want to check what class has object mouse.wts.

```{r}
class(mouse.wts)
```


Some basic functions (mean, min, max, summary) to caluculate from both samples

##Mean function


Arithmetic mean is a quantitative measure of central tendency that is highly sensitive to outliers. Value of aritmentic mean is in units as original variable! To calculate arithmentic mean in R we use following code:

```{r}
mean(mouse.wts)
```

##Min function

Minimum function calculated minimal value in the vector.

```{r}
min(mouse.wts)
```
##Max function

Maximum function calculated maximal value in the vector.

```{r}
max(mouse.wts)

```

##Summary function

Summary function gives you a descriptive statistics for the analyzed vector.

```{r}
summary(mouse.wts)
```

##Help function in R

If we need help on any function in R we could write down ?name of the function and help(name of the function in brackets)
```{r}
?summary
help(summary)
```

#Plots

##Plot

If we have a single variable then R makes a plot of the values of x (on the y-axis) ordered on the x-axis with Index from first to last value. 

```{r}
plot(mouse.wts, main="House mouse weight plot", xlab="Mouse number in the dataset", ylab="Weight (g)")
```


##Histogram

A histogram is a visual representation of the distribution of a dataset. If we want to see a histogram of the data we could use hist function:

```{r}
hist(mouse.wts, main="House mouse weight histogram", xlab="Mouse weight classes", ylab="Frequency")
```


##Box plot

Syntax for boxplot in first case is boxplot(variable_name) and in the second case boxplot(x, data=), where x is a variable name or formula and data= dataframe that provides the data. 

Boxplot for individual variables could be used for two of our created variables:

```{r}

boxplot(mouse.wts, main="House mouse weight", xlab="Species - Mouse", ylab="Weight (g)") #boxplot for the variable mouse.wts
```

## Assignment 2

1. Plot a function Z using plot function with option type ="l" to plot line instead of points:

$$ Z= x^3 -6x^2+4x+12$$
For x values use a sequence of numbers between -2.1 and 6.1 with increment 0.1. (Hint: Use seq function; seq function arguments: inital value, final value and increment)

Solution 1:

```{r}
x<-seq(-2.1,6.1,0.1)
Z<- (x^3-6*x^2+4*x+12)
plot(x,Z, type="l")
```

2. Now try to plot the same function and call it Z1 with increment for x instead by 0.1 to 1. 


```{r}
x<-seq(-2.1,6.1,1)
Z1<- (x^3-6*x^2+4*x+12)
plot(x,Z1, type="l")
```

What is the difference in plots?!
