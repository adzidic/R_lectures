# Arrange data in Excel

Arrange your data in Excel. 
Save your data under other formats option in Excel as a .csv (comma separated values) file. 
*Remember that name of the variable finger lenght should be written either as finger.length or finger_lenght, but not finger length!*

Change original file to modified file in Excel as follows:

![Original file!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/R_lectures/L3/Original_file.png)


![Modified file!](/Users/alendzidic/Documents/PROJECTS/R_lectures/L3/Modified_file.png)


After you file has been arranged put it in the working directory. To see all the files in the working directory use:
```{r}
dir()
```

# Read in your data from a Excel csv (comma separated file) file


The table format consist of three key features:

1. Header - representing first row of the data file; usually the variable names. If defined as false R reads first row as observed data values.
2. Delimiter - character used to separate the data entries in each line (usually , : ;)
3. Missing values - R will turn all missing values to NA

Usually files to be imported into R have .csv or .txt extension, but we will use .csv extension for files previously edited in Excel.

**IMPORTANT - read.table will convert all non-numeric values into factors by default.**

If you want to avoid this add option stringAsFactors = FALSE. 
Then all non-numeric values will be stored as character and with function as.factor you could return them to factors.



```{r Importing finger_length.csv in R}
mydata <- read.table("finger_lengths.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")#Be sure your file is in the R working directory!!!
mydata
```

*Note the use of the square brackets when addressing arrays [ , ]* - FIRST ROWS THEN COLUMNS!
```{r}
mydata[1,1] # extract the element of the first row and column
mydata[1,2] # extract the element of the first row and second column
mydata[1,3] # extract the element of the first row and third column
mydata[ ,3] # extract the elements of the third column
mydata[, c(1, 3)] # extract the elements of the first and third column
mydata[, c(-1, -3)] # extract all elements except first and third column
mydata$digit #extract all values for the variable digit
mydata$hand  #extract all values for the variable hand
mydata$finger.length  #extract all values for the variable finger.length
```



# Check already available datasets in R

```{r}
data() # brings the list of R build in datasets
library(help="datasets") # brings the list of R build in datasets

```

# Open one of the existing datasets in R

```{r One of the availabe datasets Orange}
data(Orange) # reads in the data in R environment
Orange # shows Orange dataset
?Orange # help file describes dataset Orange in detail
```


# Read data from web with read.table


```{r Read in data from the web in R}

SwissSquirrels <-read.table("https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/SwissSquirrels.txt")
head(SwissSquirrels)
```


# Plot your finger length data with boxplot


```{r}
boxplot(finger.length~hand, xlab="Hand", ylab="digit length(mm)", data=mydata) # Finger.length on y axis and hand on x axis

```

# Save data in R

```{r}
save( list=ls(), file="finger_data.rdata" )
```



**ASSIGNMENT**

1. Find built in dataset PlantGrowth and make boxplot for each of the treatment groups.
What is your conclusion about treatment groups applied?


```{r}
#Solution
boxplot(weight~group, xlab="Group", ylab="weight", data=PlantGrowth)
```
